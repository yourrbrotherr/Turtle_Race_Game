# Turtle_Race_Game
Created a fun and interactive Turtle Race game using Python's turtle module! In this game, six colorful turtles line up to race across the screen. Before the race begins, the player selects a turtle color to predict the winner. As the race starts, the turtles move randomly toward the finish line, creating suspense and excitement. The game ends when the first turtle crosses the finish line, and the player's prediction is checked against the winning turtle. This simple yet engaging game is a great way to learn Python's turtle graphics and basic user input handling.
